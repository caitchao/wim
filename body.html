    <div class="">
    <p class= "tropepara">In our society, people tend to tell you what you should or should not be- how you should
    look like, how you should act properly, etc. Because of the social standards that are enforced
    upon the world, people think that this is actually normal and this is what they are supposed to do.
    Any mere difference or deviance from this set standard is considered as abnormal, and conseqeuntly
    leads to people's insecurities about themselves. These standards are seen a lot in the media, which idealizes the
    "skinny supermodel body". People these days idealize the large breasts and butts, tiny waists, and the appearance of <i>curves</i>.
    People will praise you for having thick curves or a skinny body but shame you for not.</p>
    <img class="bodyimg" src="https://media.gq.com/photos/57603936c2433a86159c8da6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/kk-gq-0716-cover.jpg" alt="body">
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="tropepara">Because most movies and commercials in the media these days convey images of females
      with the "perfect body type", the general population regards this as the norm. But in reality, the images
      displayed by the media are not representative of the general population. People trust the media thinking
      that it is the reality and so, any slight difference takes a large toll on them. Far-reaching effects may
      occur because of this, such as life-threatening eating disorders, like Anorexia or Bulimia. The consequences
      that result from this false portrayal from the media is usually disregarded, as more and more people are following
      these idealized ways.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="tropepara">Have you ever used Facetune or any other beauty editing apps? Why is it that these apps make people edit their body shapes
      differently, make their eyes appear larger, or make their skin appear smoother? Two different images of two completely different
      people may end up looking like the same person with the use of these applications. And what does that person look like? The same
      image that is praised by the media and society and is falsely displayed across the world. People want to look like everyone else
      they see on shows or advertisements. Moreover, the media tends to promote these apps, and from seeing everyone, including social
      influencers, use these apps, people want to join in the crowd. But what is the point of showing the world who you are not, and
      hiding who you actually are? Nobody will distinguish your unique attributes and personalities from seeing a false image of you.
      Furthermore, if everyone looked the same way, like the media tends to portray, the world would be a very boring place.</p>

    <p class="tropepara">Another type of media portrayal of false body imaging is through the stark comparison of different characters.
    You will see that there is one character, who is the popular chic and the one everyone wants to be friends with at school. Her
    apparel is either boujee or one of the latest trends on the market. She (unrealistically) works out all the time, which attributes
    her perfect body type, where she is able to fit into the smallest sizes of clothes. Her skin is naturally perfect without
    any makeup, and she never breaks out. Then there is the complete foil of her- the girl who seems to disappear among the
    social crowds, and the one who is looked down upon by the popular groups. She dresses somewhat ordinarily and doesn't put on any
    extravagant image of herself. But she is supposed to be the "real" portrayal of ordinary people. This clear comparison
    is used by the media to categorize people into what they want to be like versus what they seem like ordinarily. This
    is very destructive on a person's self esteem because they are seeing society tell them that they are not worthy, and that
    they are supposed to be a certain way.</p>

    <div>
    <p class="tropepara">Have you ever seen a movie or show where the female gets a makeover and suddenly she is the most beautiful
    girl to grace the earth? Where was this attention to the "before" image? Are appearances all that matter to society, that
    people ignore their true personalities? Essentially, she is the same girl, because her personality and values remain the same.
    All that it takes is a change in appearance for the world to view her in a completely different way. One example is the drama called
    "Diamond Lover," where the female lead was forced to undergo facial reconstruction due to a car accident. The male lead falls in love
    with her new image and doesn't know her past. When he finally finds out about her past- she was an obese girl before, he completely leaves her and
    shames her for ever undergoing plastic surgery. But she had no choice but to do it. This truly illustrates the extent to which people only care
    about appearances, and reject a person's inner qualities.</p>
