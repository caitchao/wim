    <h1 class = "heading">Race</h1>
    <p class = "rr">Race has become a very charged topic in the media, especially with the normalization
    of racism by major political figures. More often than not, all women, regardless of race, are held up
    to a false standard of what they should be, or even just get generalized based on their race. In regards
    to women, not only are they held to sexist standards, but they also have the burden of having many racial
    stereotypes placed onto them.</p>
    <h3 class="tropehead"><strong><u>Fetishization</u></strong></h3>
    <p class="rr">In addition to the sexualization that comes with being a women, different races have
    different stereotypes which, for the most part, contribute to their sexualization. These women are
    sexy, desirable, and generally exist to be the token minority as well as satisfy the male gaze.</p>

      <li class="listed"><u>Angry Black Women</u></li>
      <li class="listed"><u>Basic B*tch</u></li>
    <p class="tropehead">Yellow Fever</p>
<p class="rr">Yellow fever is esentially the fetishization of Asian women in western media. They are often seen
as exotic lotus blossoms who are submissive, beautiful, and freaky in bed. They are sex objects for western men,
as they can't seem to stand up for themselves. </p>
<p class="tropehead">Spicy Latina</p>
<p class="rr">The Spicy Latina character is esentially the only latina in the story, and she happens to play into every
racial stereotype about hispanic women out there. She's fiesty, opinionated, exciting in the sheets, and still has the ideal curves
and body for the male gaze. Her opinion is ignored, as she's seen as always angry, and they're often seen as little more than
 loud.</p>

 <p class="tropehead">Angry Black Women</p>
 <p class="rr">Besides the all too often stereotypes of being "loud" or "ghetto", African American women are also known as being almost
 exotic-like to men of other races. In many movies, black women are there to start, or be in a fight. Oftentimes, they are not seen in the same
light as white women, or women of other races. They are seen as too loud for their own good, and not at all gracious, or quiet. Media has often portrayed
black women to be the same everywhere, ignoring the fact that these are real people and they are not for someone else's pleasure.  </p>
