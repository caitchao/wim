    <h1 class = "heading">Sexuality</h1>
    <p class="sex">In a world that is gradually becoming more accepting of the LGBT community, the portrayal of
    WLW (woman-loving-woman) relationships in media has become more prevalent. While this may seem
    like an opportunity for previously marginalized relationships to get the representation they deserve,
    more often than not this "representation" still perpetuates stereotypes of relationships between
    lesbian and bisexual women.</p>
    <h3 class="tropehead"><strong><u>Lesbian Women</u></strong></h3>
    <div id = "sapphic">
      <p class="lesbian sex">In the media, relationships between lesbian women usually disregard the romantic
      aspects of their relationships in favor of seeing them eye candy for straight men. LGBT media that gets produced
      by non-LGBT people turns any LGBT character into a token minority, meaning someone whose entire characterization
      is based around their sexuality (or in other cases, their race or gender). Relationships between lesbians are reduced to
      2 girls simply fooling around, or engaging in romantic/sexual acts for the male gaze.</p>
      <p class = "lesbian sex">Even worse, this belief perpetuates the belief behind corrective rape: that sexuality is something that can be "cured". In the case of
      lesbian relationships, being raped by someone who identifies as male will "cure" a victim and make her straight.
      This leaves the victim feeling violated, traumatized, and completely stripped of her right to identity.</p>

    <div id = "bisexual">
      <h3 class="tropehead"><strong><u>Bisexual Women</u></strong></h3>
      <p class="sex bi">Bisexuality is commonly (mistakenly) seen as attraction to both men and women. In reality, it is simply
      attraction to two or more genders. Regardless of how one interprets the definition, bisexuality is commonly
      reduced to "just being a phase" (much like other sexualities that fall under the LGBT umbrella) or simply
      a person being greedy. Those who identify as bisexual are perceived as being liars, more open to threesomes,
      or being more sexually promiscuous in general, which is a misinterpretation of the defintiion of being bisexual.
    </p><p class="sex bi">Bisexuality is seen as a 50/50 attraction to men and women, and despite being a member of the
      LGBT community, there is also biphobia present within gay and lesbian communities in that they are not "truly queer"
      so long as they are attracted to the opposite gender.</p>
