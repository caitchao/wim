        <h1 class = "heading">Female Tropes</h1>
        <p class = "tropepara">Do you oftentimes watch movies or read books that have "typical"
          female characters with "typical" qualities? Like that girl who is crazy
          for crushing on a guy, or that lady who only cares about her romantic
          endeavors? Some of these stereotypes
          are deemed normal in today's society, and are even used as sources
          of satire and humor. People grow up watching these outlets of media,
          and consequently, they grow up thinking that these tropes are real and just.
          But these ways of thinking are merely enforced upon our society, and we have
          the power to change the way we perceive females in our world.</p>

        <p class = "tropepara">When a woman shows her strength and prowess, she is immediately thought of as
        "badass". Others do not consider that women do possess skills and that they do not
        sit still and look pretty as some people perceive they do. People do not realize the
        adeptness of females because they are so adament about their preconceptions.
        They put into their minds that women should not work, they should not show how strong they are,
        and that they should just be elegant and graceful.
        When females rise to the top positions of their careers, they are also thought of as
        heartless or cunning, and they are misjudged for using deceptive or romantic
        ways to reach their points.</p></div>

        <h3 class="tropehead"><strong><u>The Damsel in Distress</u></strong></h3>
        <p class = "tropepara2">Frequently, the media depict women as people who wait for the man to
        come to the rescue and save them. They are portrayed as weak, frail, and helpless. They cannot
        prevail alone without the assistance of a man. In movies, they are sometimes abducted or abused, and they
        wait for the man to rescue them, without doing anything themselves. Other times, the media may even
        portray the woman falling in love with the man who abducted her.</p>

        <h3 class="tropehead right"><strong><u>The "Boy Crazy"</u></strong></h3>
        <p class="tropepara3">Many people oftentimes think that women cannot have a simple conversation without talking about men.
          There is a presumption that women would go out of their way to impress a male figure, whether it is through changing their
          appearance, seduction, or other means. People are also wary of women- they classify some women as gold-diggers who
          want men for their money and have greedy intentions. Even a mere crush becomes a means of "stalking." The double standards
          are evident as men are rewarded for their intentions of protecting women when they are after a girl. </p>
