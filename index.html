  <!-- <h1 class = "heading">Women In Media</h1> -->
  <p class = "beginning">Oftentimes, women are sexualized and fantasized for the male gaze in media.
    It may be as simple as enforcing an unrealistic body image for people to idealize,
    or it may be as complicated as signaling to women that all they can be are sex objects
    made for male pleasure. Even in 2019, women are often portrayed as one-dimensional, impractical
    characters that fall for serious abusers or society's misogynistic standards. The creators of this
    website wanted to educate the public on how widespread sexism is in the media. Many people may not
    recognize and acknowledge some of the bias that we see in movies and on tv shows, as we have normalized
    it from years and years of seeing it on screen. In the Navigation bar, you can access pages that explaining
    different examples of bias and discrimination, such as romantisied abuse and meaningless personalities. The
    creators hope that by building this website, we can inform people about the unfair depictions of women in
    entertainment, which would then lead to pushes for change in the way women are written- not based on their
    sexuality, but on their personality.</p>
