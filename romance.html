    <h1 class = "heading">Romance</h1>

  <p class="rr">Romantic relationships, sadly, often make up the majority of interactions with
  female characters in entertainment. Many of the actions by men to women we see in
  media are often romantisized, even if the reality is that the behavior is a classic sign of
  abuse.</p>
<p class="tropehead">Stockholm Syndrome</p>
<p class="kidnap">In movies such as "In Time" and "Passengers", we see the female lead get kidnapped by the
male lead, only to fall for him later. This is oftentimes the main, and only reason why the female character
is introduced. Not only is this highly unrealistic, as it is incredibly doubtful that every woman kidnapped would
suddenly develop stockholm syndrome for their kidnapper, it is also romantisizing abusive relationships. These pop
culture couples are simply implying to women that a boyfriend or a husband who takes them away from their friends and family,
esentially holding them hostage, is ok, as it's all for love, which it is not.</p>
<p class="tropehead">No means Try Harder</p>
<p class="rejection">In so many movies, and with so many popular couples, rejection is often taken as a sign of playing hard-to-get,
rather than just not being interested. In "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back", Hans Solo makes repeated advances on Princess Leia,
despite her eight obvious rejections. Even in 2019, male characters oftentimes never back down until the female character either agrees
to a) go out with him or b)kiss him. This leads to a constant barrage of male advances towards women in real life, and them often not
understanding how to take no for an answer. This also could lead to sexual harrasment, or even sexual assault when men take no as a sign
to take control of the advances.</p>

<p class="tropehead">The Fixer Upper</p>
<p class="emotionless">This false portrayal applies to both male and female characters. For men, the main love interest is often there just to humanize
him, or to show that emotions are ok. This implies that women are there to better the men, which in turn ignores the fact that women
aren't only there to better the men. In female portrayals, they are often seen as the cutthroat career girl who focuses on her job, and her
job only-since you can't have both, right? She is often ruthless, that is, until a guy comes into her life and suddenly makes her realize
that she can be a human with emotions and sucessful. This play into the I need a man stereotype, which has continued to harm women to this
day.</p>

<p class="tropehead">The Hot Person Rule</p>
<p class="hpr">The Hot Person Rule, esentially, is the idea that stalking, and abusive actions from somebody is not only ok, but romantic,
when it comes from a person who is considered attractive. This is esentially the entire movie of Twilight, Fifty Shades of Gray, and The
Notebook. This is not only excusing predatory and abusive behavior, but also enforcing society's belief of beauty. No matter how hot somebody is,
predatory behavior is never ok, even if they claim it is just because they are attracted to you. </p>
<p></p>
<p class="tropehead">Born Sexy Yesterday</p>
<p class="emotionless">The infamous Born Sexy Yesterday stereotype is often played out in science fiction movies from any decade. It essentially is the
relationship between a woman who mentally, is new to Earth and it's social norms, and a guy who teaches her about Earth while falling for her. This trope is
damagin and incredibly predatory, as the man is esentailly falling for someone with a child like mindset but the body of a sexualized woman. A famous example of
this is in "Tron Legacy", where the main character, Sam, falls for an andriod character, Quorra. Another example of this is in "The Fifth Element", where Leeloo
is completely oblivious to how society works, and Korben has to teach her while falling in love with her. </p>
